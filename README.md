* [ ] Run the DDL script
* [ ] Does the script create the database?
* [ ] Does the script create all of the tables?

_If it helps, use Workbench to reverse engineer a database model diagram to review the table relationships_

* [ ] Re-run the DDL script
* [ ] Does the script drop database if it exists?

## DML

**If the DML script doesn't contain the create and insert statements for the provided denormalized data, then use Workbench to import the provided CSV file**
